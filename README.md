# excel-contact-sheet
Contact sheet for people who want a slightly less manual way to record visitors, and do not have the infra or technology to do automated contact tracing.

I've written a simple formula to automatically fill up the datetime columns when a name is added to a list, or when the said name has left the premises. 

Please use responsibly.
